# Smart Cart System

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Smart Cart System** is a data-driven application designed to enhance the shopping experience by analyzing product, customer, or transaction data.  
The project demonstrates how data processing and machine learning techniques can be used to build intelligent retail solutions such as recommendations, billing automation, or purchase analysis.

This notebook focuses on data exploration, preprocessing, and model implementation to simulate a smart shopping cart concept.
